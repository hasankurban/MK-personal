The structural, electronic, optical and reactivity properties of mentioned complexes are investigated in detail. Adsorption energies between the CNT and 5-FU are calculated in the range of −3.79 and −4.38 kcal/mol. Herein, the adsorption of the 5-FU on B-doped CNT is very weak, while stronger adsorption takes place in the case of Al- and Ga-doped CNTs. The results mean that the Al and Ga dopant increases the adsorption capacity of CNT with enhancing its interactions with oxygen atoms of the 5-FU. The charge transfer from adsorbed the 5-FU to Al- and Ga-doped CNTs was confirmed by the natural bond orbital, Mulliken charges, FBO and LBO analyses. It is found that the adsorption of 5-FU on Al-doped CNT is relatively stronger than that of Ga-doped CNT. The NCI-RDG analyses also verify these findings. The first absorption peaks suggest that the B-, A, Ga doped CNTs can absorb in the visible light region. Finally, Al-doped CNT has more desirable properties to use it as a drug delivery system.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"181c5c75dd838d23fa256a40ed33905e","permalink":"/project/3/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/3/","section":"project","summary":"Theoretical investigation of the adsorption behaviors of fluorouracil as an anticancer drug on pristine and B-, Al-, Ga-doped C36 nanotube","tags":["Carbon nanotube","Fluorouracil","Doping","Adsorption","NCI-RDG analysis","DFT"],"title":"Improving drug delivery systems for healthy cells","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The performance of organic cells based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) has improved recently, but further improvements are necessary. In this work, we have carried out a thorough examination using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)-DFT to investigate the structural and optoelectronic properties of pentacene-based organic molecules (PbOMs) as potential donor material for organic photovoltaic BHJ devices. Our results show that oxadiazole prefers to attach via its nitrogen atoms to the carbon atoms of the pentacene monomer with an adsorption energy about − 32.86 kcal/mol, which means that oxadiazole is efficiently adsorbed on the edge of the pentacene. The HOMO energy level of the PbOM with the lowest bandgap is − 4.00 eV wide, i.e., about 0.86 eV lower and more positive than pentacene, thus providing an ideal open-circuit voltage for photovoltaic devices. The bandgap of the PbOM compounds are about 1.61 and 1.80 eV affording an efficient charge transfer from donor to acceptor. Furthermore, the donor PbOMs are also more stable than the pentacene. We have examined, additionally, the reactivity and absorption properties of individual molecules and PbOM systems.

In this work, sulfur electrodes are coated with TiO2 thin films via a magnetron sputtering technique at varying deposition times. A stable capacity contribution (66%) from the long-chain to short-chain LiPs reactions is achieved for the TiO2 coated electrodes, whereas a decline from 66% to 62% is observed for the uncoated electrode. This indicates a reversible use of the long-chain LiPs for the TiO2 coated electrodes, representing a more efficient utilization of the active material. Correspondingly, the capacity retention is improved from 68.8% to 88.5% after TiO2 coating. The TiO2 coated electrode delivers a capacity of 570 mAh/g after 120 cycles at 0.1 C, which is 40% greater than that of the uncoated electrode. Similarly, the TiO2 coated electrode delivers a capacity of 427 mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.5 C, which is 67% greater than that of the uncoated electrode. Analysis of the binding energies of LiPs that are adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by theoretical calculations shows that strong Li–O bonds dominate the interactions between the LiPs and TiO2 layer. It is suggested that magnetron sputtered TiO2 at the electrode–electrolyte interface can be effective in suppressing the shuttle effect due to the strong polysulfide adsorbing properties of the TiO2 thin film.\n","date":1578009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578009600,"objectID":"3ff898f99dcd9f780481692132bf15f6","permalink":"/project/6/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/6/","section":"project","summary":"Suppression of the Shuttle Effect in Li–S Batteries via Magnetron Sputtered TiO2 Thin Film at the Electrode–Electrolyte Interface","tags":["TiO2 thin film","magnetron sputtering","lithium−sulfur batteries","lithium polysulfide","shuttle effect"],"title":"Suppression of the Shuttle Effect in Li–S Batteries","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Density functional theory (DFT) is used for investigating the electronic structure and optical properties carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with doped B, Al, Ga, Si, Ge, N, P and As and different diameters.
